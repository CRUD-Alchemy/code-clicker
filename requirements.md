### Why should we care about our product?

- Code Clicker helps with users that are reluctant or unable to spend money on phone apps by providing them with an alternative to pay walls so that they can have access to the app in a manner that is sustainable for developers.

- Interact with the main input button to generate more lines of code (currency).
- Purchase new code-per-second generators from a store using the code lines as currency.
